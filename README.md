# Machine-Learning-Stock-Prediction
This project was started August 3rd, 2020 and is currently under development. The goal is to use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict the effect of news stories on market prices for stocks.

The most up to date dataset is available from here: [News_Articles.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kM8u5sf7a3pbdoD27s-9VuGmCMi9eKKJ/view?usp=sharing)

To run the scraper you'll need the following libraries:
```
pip install pandas newsapi-python 
```
You'll also need to sign up for an [API key](https://newsapi.org/s/google-news-api) and set it as an environment 
variable named NEWS_API_KEY.

To view the current notebook you can open it in Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shaye059/Machine-Learning-Stock-Prediction/blob/master/Stock_Prediction.ipynb)
. The notebook is currently undergoing some heavy editing so it's probably not runnable at this time.
