# Machine-Learning-Stock-Prediction
The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict the effects of news stories on company stock prices.

The most up to date dataset is available from here: [News_Articles.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kM8u5sf7a3pbdoD27s-9VuGmCMi9eKKJ/view?usp=sharing)

To run the scraping you'll need the following libraries:
```
pip install pandas newsapi-python yfinance
```
You'll also need to sign up for an [API key](https://newsapi.org/s/google-news-api) and set it as an environment 
variable named NEWS_API_KEY.

To view the current notebook you can open it in Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shaye059/Machine-Learning-Stock-Prediction/blob/master/Stock_Prediction.ipynb)
. The notebook is currently undergoing some heavy editing so it's probably not runnable at this time.
