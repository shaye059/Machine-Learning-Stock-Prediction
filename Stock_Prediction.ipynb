        "**Update: I've come to the realization that the baseline model will probably never be able to learn on the size of dataset I can possibly extract. Instead of the approach mentioned here, I'm going to instead feed the sentences to a sentence encoder and then input those encodings into an XGboost model to perform the regression. I can perhaps experiment with some pre-trained sentiment encoders as well if I find the model still isn't able to learn anything.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea of this project is to be able to predict stock price movement based on news articles. I'll be looking at the stock price from just before the article was published and then comparing it to a few hours after. The theory is that news takes time to dissipate to all share holders so if this model can predict the affect of a news article on the price several hours later, someone could decide to buy or short the stock based on that prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll be starting out with a baseline model where I'll lemmatize the sentences and remove common words like \"the\" and \"a'. From there I'll convert the sentences into sparse arrays and then attempt to train a model based on those.\n",
        "\n",
        "~~Afterward, I'll expirement with preprocessing the sentences through sentence encoders and using different models.~~ This is now the current plan due to the size of the dataset I'll be able to scrape."

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
